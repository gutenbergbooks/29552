<h2>.The temple of glas.</h2>


<p>For thought constreynt &amp; greuous heuynes<br/>
For pensifhed and hig&#295; distres<br/>
To bed I went now this other nyght<br/>
Whan that lucina wit&#295; hir pale light<br/>
Was Ioyned last wit&#295; phebus in aquarye<br/>
Amyd decembre, whan of Ianuarye<br/>
Ther be kalendes of the new yere<br/>
And derk dyane horned and nothing clere<br/>
Had her beames vnder a mysty cloude<br/>
Wit&#295; in my bed for cold I gan me shroude<br/>
Al desolate for constraynt of my woo<br/>
The long nyght walowyng to and fro<br/>
Til at laste er I began take kepe<br/>
Me dyde oppresse a sodeyn dedly slepe<br/>
Wit&#295; in the whiche me thoug&#295;t I was<br/>
Rauysshed in spiryte in to a temple of glas<br/>
I nyste how fer in wildernes<br/>
That founded was as by liklynes<br/>
Not vpon stele, but on a craggy roche<br/>
Lyke yse y froze, and as I did approche<br/>
Agayn the sonne that shone so clere</p>

<p>As ony Cristal and euer ner and ner<br/>
As I cam nyghe this grisly dredful place<br/>
I wex astonyed, the light so in my face<br/>
Be gan to smyte, so persing euer in one<br/>
On euery part wher that I gan gone<br/>
That I ne might no thing as I wolde<br/>
Aboute me considere and beholde<br/>
The wonder estres for brightnes of the sonne<br/>
Til atte last certayn skyes donne<br/>
Wit&#295; wynde chaced han her cours y went<br/>
To fore the stremes of titan and y blent<br/>
So that I mighte wit&#295; in and wit&#295; oute<br/>
Wherso I wolde beholden me aboute<br/>
For to reporte the fac&#333;n and manere<br/>
Of a&#410;&#410; this place that was circuler<br/>
In compas wyse, round by entayle wrought<br/>
And whan I had longe gone and sought<br/>
I found a wiket and entred in as fast<br/>
In to the temple and myn eyen cast<br/>
On euery syde now lowe eft alofte<br/>
And right anon as I gan walken softe<br/>
Yf I the sot&#295; a right reporte shal<br/>
I sawe depeynted vpon a wal</p>

<p>From este to weste many a fair ymage<br/>
Of sondry louers lyke as they were of age<br/>
Y sette in ordre after they were trewe<br/>
Wit&#295; liuely colours wonder fresh of hue<br/>
And as me thought I sawe som sitte &amp; som st&#257;de<br/>
And som&#772;e knelyng wit&#295; billes in their hande<br/>
And som&#772;e wit&#295; compleynt woful &amp; pietous<br/>
Wit&#295; doleful chere to putten to venus<br/>
So as she sat fleetyng in the see<br/>
Vpon her woo forto haue pitee<br/>
And first of alle I saug&#295; there of cartage<br/>
Dido the quene so goodly of visage<br/>
That gan compleyne hir auenture and cas<br/>
How she deceyued was of Eneas<br/>
For al his hestes and his othes sworn<br/>
And said alas that euer she was born<br/>
Whan she sawe that ded she must be<br/>
And next I sawe the compleynt of Medee<br/>
How that she falsed was of Iason<br/>
And nyg&#295; by venus sawe I sitte atheon<br/>
And al the maner how the boor hym sloug&#295;<br/>
For whom she wepte and had pyne ynoug&#295;<br/>
Ther saw I also how that penolope</p>

<p>For she so longe her lord ne mighte see<br/>
Was of colour bothe pale and grene<br/>
And after next was the fresh quene<br/>
I mene alcest the noble trewe wyf<br/>
And for admete hou she lost her lif<br/>
And for her trout&#295; yf I shal not lye<br/>
How she was torned in to a daysye<br/>
Ther was Grisildes Innocence<br/>
And al her mekenes and pacience<br/>
There was eke Isode &amp; many other moo<br/>
And al the torment and the cruel woo<br/>
That she had for tristram al her lyue<br/>
And how that Tisbe her hert dyde ryue<br/>
Wit&#295; thilk swerd of sir Piramus<br/>
And al the maner hou that Theseus<br/>
The mynotaure slow amyd the hous<br/>
That was forwrynked by crafte of dedalus<br/>
Whan he was in pryson shit in Crete<br/>
And how that philles felte of loues hete<br/>
The grete fyre of demephon allas<br/>
And for his falshed and for his trespas<br/>
Vpon the walles depeynt men might see<br/>
How she henge vpon a fylberd tree</p>

<p>And many a story moo than I rekene can<br/>
Were in the temple, and how that paris wan<br/>
The fayr Eleyne a lusty fresh quene<br/>
And hou Achilles was for Policene<br/>
Y slayn vnwarly wit&#295;yn Troye toun<br/>
Al this sawe I walkyng vp and doun<br/>
Ther sawe I wreton eke the hole tale<br/>
How Philomene in to a nyghtyngale<br/>
Y torned was, and proigne vnto a swalowe<br/>
And how the sabyns in their maner halowe<br/>
The feste of lucresse yet in Rome toun<br/>
Ther saw I also the sorow of Palamon<br/>
That he in prison felte and al the smert<br/>
And how that he thurg&#295; vnto his hert<br/>
Was hurt vnwarly by castyng of an eye<br/>
On fair fresh the lusty yong Emelye<br/>
And al the stryf bytwene hym &amp; his brother<br/>
And how that one faug&#295;t wit&#295; that other<br/>
Wit&#295;yn the groue, til they by Theseus<br/>
Accorded were as Chaucer tellet&#295; vs<br/>
And furthermore as I gan beholde<br/>
I sawe hou phebus wit&#295; an arowe of golde<br/>
Y wounded was thurg&#295; out his syde</p>

<p>Only by enuye of the god Cupyde<br/>
And how that dyane vnto a laurer tre<br/>
Y torned was whan that she dide fle<br/>
And how that Ioue changed his cope<br/>
Only for loue of the fair Eurepe<br/>
And in to a hole, whan he did he sue<br/>
Liste of his godhed his fourme to transmue<br/>
And hou that he by transmutacion<br/>
The shap gan take of Amphitrion<br/>
For Alcumena so passing was of beaute<br/>
So was he hurt for al his deyte<br/>
Wit&#295; louys dart, and might it not escape<br/>
Ther sawe I also how mars was take<br/>
Of vulcanus and wit&#295; venus founde<br/>
And wit&#295; the cheynes Inuysible bounde<br/>
Ther was also al the poesye<br/>
Of hym Mercurye and al the philogye<br/>
And how that she for her sapience<br/>
Y wedded was to the god of eloquence<br/>
And how the Muses lowly did obeye<br/>
Hig&#295; in to heuyn this lady to conueye<br/>
And wit&#295; her songe hou she was magnefied<br/>
Wit&#295; Jubiter there to be stellefied</p>

<p>And vppermore depeynt men might see<br/>
How wit&#295; her ryng the goodly canace<br/>
Of euery fowle, the leydons and songe<br/>
Coude vnderstond as she walked them among<br/>
And hou her brother so often holpen was<br/>
In his myschief, by the stede of bras<br/>
And furthermore in the temple were<br/>
Ful many a thousand louers here &amp; there<br/>
In sondry wyse redy to compleyne<br/>
Vnto the goddesse, of her woo and peyne<br/>
How they were hyndred som for enuye<br/>
And how the serpent of fals Ielousie<br/>
Ful many a louer hath put a back<br/>
And causeles on them haue leid a lack<br/>
And som&#772;e ther were that playned on absence<br/>
That were exiled and put out of presence<br/>
Thurg&#295; wicked tunges and fals suspec&#333;n<br/>
Wit&#295;oute mercy or ony remissi&#333;n<br/>
And other eke her seruyse spent in veyn<br/>
And of her lady were not loued ageyn<br/>
And other eke that for pouerte<br/>
Dursten in no wyse her grete aduersite<br/>
Discouere ne opene, lest they were refused</p>

<p>And som&#772;e for wantyng also were accused<br/>
And other eke that loued secretly<br/>
And of her lady durst axe no mercy<br/>
Lest that she wolde of hym haue despyte<br/>
And som&#772;e also that putten right grete wite<br/>
Ou double louers that loue thinges newe<br/>
Thurg&#295; whos falsenes hyndred be the trewe<br/>
And som&#772; there were as hit is ofte founde<br/>
That for her lady many a blody wounde<br/>
Endured hat&#295; in many a regyon<br/>
Whiles that an other hat&#295; had possession<br/>
Al of his lady and beret&#295; a way the fruyt<br/>
Of his labour and of a&#410;&#410; his fuyt<br/>
And other compleyned of richesse<br/>
How he wit&#295; tresour dot&#295; his besynesse<br/>
To wynne agaynst al kynde and right<br/>
Where as true louers haue force none ne might<br/>
And som ther were as maydyns yong of age<br/>
That pleynet&#295; so wit&#295; pipyng &amp; wit&#295; rage<br/>
That were coupled agayn al nature<br/>
Wit&#295; croked elde that may not long endure<br/>
For to perfourme the lust of loues playe<br/>
For hit ne fit not vnto fress&#295; maye</p>

<p>For to be coupled to olde Ianuarye<br/>
They be so dyuerse that they must varye<br/>
For elde is gruoching and malencolious<br/>
Ay ful of yre and suspecious<br/>
And yongth entendet&#295; to Ioye &amp; lustynes<br/>
To mirt&#295; and play and to al gladnes<br/>
Allas that euer hit shold falle<br/>
So swete sugre y coupled be to galle<br/>
These yonge folke cryeden oft sithe<br/>
And praid venus her power to kythe<br/>
Vpon this myschief and shape remedye<br/>
And right anone I herde other crye<br/>
Wit&#295; sobbyng teres and pietous sowne<br/>
To fore the goddesse by lamentacion<br/>
That were constrayned in their yougthe<br/>
And in childhode as is ofte couthe<br/>
Y entrid were in to Religion<br/>
Or they had yeris of discresc&#333;n<br/>
That al her lif can not but compleyne<br/>
In wyde Copes perfection forto feyne<br/>
Ful couertly for to coueren thair smert<br/>
And shewe the contrary of thair hert<br/>
Thus saw I wepe many a fair mayde</p>

<p>That on theyr frendes al the wyte thay layde<br/>
And other next I saw ther in grete rage<br/>
That they were maried in theyr tendre age<br/>
Wit&#295; oute fredom of fre election<br/>
Where loue hat&#295; selde domynacion<br/>
For loue at large and at liberte<br/>
Wolde frely chese and not wit&#295; suche trete<br/>
And other saw I ful ofte wepe and wrynge<br/>
That they in men fonde suche varyynge<br/>
To loue a season whyle that beaulte flourit&#295;<br/>
And after by disdayn so vngoodly lourit&#295;<br/>
On her that whylom he callyd his lady dere<br/>
That was to hym so playsant and entier<br/>
But lust wit&#295; fairnes is so ouer goon<br/>
That in her herte trouthe abidet&#295; noon<br/>
And som&#772;e also I sawe in teres reyne<br/>
And pietously on god and kynde pleyne<br/>
That euer they wold on ony creature<br/>
So moche beaute passing be mesure<br/>
Sette on a woman to yeue occasion<br/>
A man, to loue to his confusion<br/>
And namely there, where he shal haue no grace<br/>
For wit&#295; a loke fort&#295; by as he dot&#295; pace</p>

<p>Ful ofte fallet&#295; thurg&#295; castyng of an eye<br/>
A man is wounded that he must nedis deye<br/>
That neuer peraunter after he shal her see<br/>
Why wil god don so grete a cruelte<br/>
To ony man, or to his creature<br/>
To make hym so muche woo endure<br/>
For her, percas, whom he shal in no wyse<br/>
Reioyse neuer, but so fort&#295; in Iuyse<br/>
Lede his lif til that he be graue<br/>
For he ne durst of hir no mercy craue<br/>
And eke peraunter thoug&#295; he durst &amp; wolde<br/>
He can not wite where he hir fynd sholde<br/>
I sawe ther eke, and therof had I couthe<br/>
That som were hyndred by couetyse &amp; slougthe<br/>
And som&#772;e also for their hastynes<br/>
And other eke for their rechelesnes<br/>
But altherlast as I walked and behelde<br/>
Beside pallas wit&#295; her Cristal sheld<br/>
Tofore the statue of venus set on height<br/>
Ther kneled a lady in my sight<br/>
To fore the goddesse, whiche as the sonne<br/>
Passet&#295; the sterris, and eke the stormys donne<br/>
And lucifer to voyde the nyghtes sorowe</p>

<p>In clerenes passet&#295; erly the morowe<br/>
And so as maye hat&#295; the souereynte<br/>
Of euery monet&#295; the fayrnes and beaute<br/>
And as the rose in swetnes and odour<br/>
Surmounted flouris, and baine of al licour<br/>
Hath the pryse, and as the rubye bright<br/>
Of al stones in beaute and in sight<br/>
As it is knowe hat&#295; the Regalye<br/>
Right so this ladye wit&#295; her goodly eye<br/>
And wit&#295; the stremys of hir loke so bright<br/>
Surmountet&#295; al thourg&#295; beaute in my sight<br/>
That for to tel her grete semelines<br/>
Her womanhed her porte and her fairnes<br/>
Hit was a meruayle, how euer that nature<br/>
Cowde in her werkes make a creature<br/>
So angelyk so goodly on to see<br/>
So femynyn or passing of beaute<br/>
Whos sonnys&#295; heer brighter than goldwire<br/>
Lyche phebus beames shynyng in his spyre<br/>
The goodlihed eke of her fres&#295; face<br/>
So replenyshed of beaute and of grace<br/>
So wel ennewed by nature and depeynt<br/>
As Rose and lilyes to gyder were meynt</p>

<p>So egally by good proporcion<br/>
That as me tought by myn inspection<br/>
I gan meruaylle hou god or werk of kynde<br/>
Mighten of beaute suche a tresour fynde<br/>
To yeuen hir so passing excellence<br/>
For in good fait&#295; thurg&#295; her hye presence<br/>
The temple was ensumyned enuyron<br/>
And forto speke of her condicion<br/>
She was the beste that might be on lyue<br/>
For ther was none that wit&#295; her might stryue<br/>
To speke of bounte or of gentilesse<br/>
Of womanhede or of lowlynesse<br/>
Of curtoysie or of goodlihede<br/>
Of speche of chere or of semelihede<br/>
Of poort benigne or of daliaunce<br/>
The best taught and therto of playsaunce<br/>
She was the welle eke of honeste<br/>
An Examplair and mirrour eke was she<br/>
Of secretnes of trouthe of feit&#295;fulnes<br/>
And to alle other lady and maistres<br/>
To shewe vertu who so list to lere<br/>
And so this lady right humble of chere<br/>
Kneling I sawe, clad in grene and whyte</p>

<p>To fore venus goddesse of al delyte<br/>
Enbrowded al wit&#295; stones and perre<br/>
So richely that Ioye it was to see<br/>
Wit&#295; sondry rolles on her garnement<br/>
For texpowne the trout&#295; of her entent<br/>
To shewe fully that for her humblesse<br/>
And for her vertu and her stablenesse<br/>
That she was cote of al womanly playsance<br/>
Therfore her word wit&#295;oute variance<br/>
Enbrowded was as men might see<br/>
De mieulx en mieulx wit&#295; stones of perre<br/>
This is to sayne that she was so benygne<br/>
From better to better her hert dot&#295; resigne<br/>
And al her wy&#410;&#410; to venus the goddesse<br/>
Whan that her list her harmes to redresse<br/>
For as me thought somwhat by her chere<br/>
For to compleyne she had grete desire<br/>
For in her hand she held a lityl bylle<br/>
For to declare the sum&#772;e of al her wylle<br/>
And to the goddesse her quarel for to shewe<br/>
Theffect of whiche was in wordes fewe</p>

And hool my loue in al honeste<br/>
Wit&#295;oute chaunge al be hit secretly<br/>
I haue no space wit&#295; hym for to be<br/>
O lady venus consider now and see<br/>
Vnto theffecte and compleynt of my by&#410;&#410;<br/>
Sit&#295; lyf and det&#295; I put a&#410;&#410; in thy wy&#410;&#410;</p>

<p>And tho me thought the goddes did enclyne<br/>
Mekely her hede and softly gan expresse<br/>
That in short tyme her torment shold fyne<br/>
And how of hym for whom al her distresse<br/>
Contynned had and al her heuynesse<br/>
She shold haue Ioye and of her purgatorye<br/>
Be holpen sone and so lyue fort&#295; in glorye</p>

<p>And said doughter for thy sad trouthe<br/>
Thy fait&#295;ful menyng and Innocence<br/>
That planted be wit&#295; outen ony slouthe<br/>
In your persone deuoyed of al offence<br/>
So han they atteyned to our audience<br/>
That wit&#295; our grace ye shal be wel releuyd<br/>
I you behete of al that hat&#295; you greuyd</p>

<p>And for that ye be euer of one entent<br/>
Wit&#295;oute chaunge or mutabilyte<br/>
And in your paynes ben so pacient<br/>
To take lowly your aduersyte<br/>
And that so longe thurgh the cruelte<br/>
Of olde saturne my fader vnfortuned<br/>
Your woo shal now no lenger be contuned</p>

<p>And thinket&#295; this wit&#295; in a litil whyle<br/>
Hit shal aswage and ouer passen sone<br/>
For men by laysir passen many a myle<br/>
And ofte after a droppyng mone<br/>
The weder cleret&#295;, and whan the storme is done<br/>
The sonne shynet&#295; in his spyer bright<br/>
And Ioye waket&#295; whan woo is putto flight</p>

<p>Remembre eke how neuer yet no wight<br/>
Ne cam to worship wit&#295; out som debate<br/>
And folke reioyse also more of light<br/>
That they wit&#295; derknes were waped &amp; mate<br/>
No ma&ntilde;s cha&ntilde;ce is allewey fortunate<br/>
Ne no wight preyset&#295; of sugre the swetnes<br/>
But they to fore haue tasted bitternes</p>

<p>Gryssyld was asayed atte fu&#410;&#410;<br/>
That torned after to encrese of Ioye<br/>
Penolope gan eke for sorowes dulle<br/>
For that her lord abode so long at troye<br/>
Also the torment ther coude noman accoye<br/>
Of dorygene flour of al Bretaigne<br/>
Thus euer Ioye is fyn and ende of payne</p>

<p>And trustet&#295; this for conclusion<br/>
The ende of sorow is Ioye voyde of drede<br/>
For hoolly seyntes thurg&#295; her passion<br/>
Haue heuyn wonne by their souerain mede<br/>
And plente gladly folowet&#295; after nede<br/>
And so my doughter after your greuaunce<br/>
I you behote ye shal haue ful plesaunce</p>

<p>For euer of loue the maner and the gyse<br/>
Is for to hurte his seruaunt &amp; to wounde<br/>
And whan he hat&#295; taught them his empryse<br/>
He can in Ioye make them to habounde<br/>
And sit&#295; that ye haue in my laas be bounde<br/>
Wit&#295; oute gruoching or rebellyon<br/>
Ye muste of night haue consolacion</p>

<p>This to sayne dowtet&#295; neuer a deel<br/>
That ye shal haue ful possession<br/>
Of hym that ye now cherisshe so weel<br/>
In honest maner wit&#295; oute offencion<br/>
By cause I knowe youre entencion<br/>
Is truly sette in party and in a&#410;&#410;<br/>
To loue hym best and most in specia&#410;&#410;</p>

<p>For he that ye haue chosen you to serue<br/>
Shal be to you suche as ye desire<br/>
Wit&#295; oute chaunge fully til he sterue<br/>
So wit&#295; my bronde I haue sette hym a fyre<br/>
And wit&#295; my grace I shal hym so enspyre<br/>
That he in herte shal be right at your wylle<br/>
Wherso you liste to saue hym or to spylle</p>

<p>For vnto you I shal his herte so lowe<br/>
Wit&#295; oute spotte of ony doblenesse<br/>
That he ne shal escape from the bowe<br/>
Thaug&#295; that hym self by vnstedfastnesse<br/>
I mene of cupide that shal hym so distresse<br/>
Vnto your honde wit&#295; tharowe of golde<br/>
That he ne shal escapen thaugh he wolde</p>

<p>And sith ye list of pyte and of grace<br/>
In vertu only his yonghthe to cherisshe<br/>
I shal by aspectes of my benigne face<br/>
Make hym beschewe euery synne and vice<br/>
So that he shal haue no maner spice<br/>
In his corage to loue thinges newe<br/>
He shal to yow so playn be found and trewe</p>

<p>And whan this goodly fair fress&#295; of hue<br/>
Humble and benygne of trout&#295; crop &amp; rote<br/>
Conceyued had how venus gan to rewe<br/>
On her prayer plainly to do bote<br/>
To chaunge her bitter attones in to sote<br/>

Vpon your auters your fest yer by yer<br/>

<p>For of your grace I am ful reconsiled<br/>
From euery troble vnto ioye and ease<br/>
That sorowes alle be from me exiled<br/>
Sit&#295; ye my lady list now tappease<br/>

Vnto gladnes so sodenly to torne<br/>
Hauyng no cause from hens fort&#295; to morne</p>

<p>For sithen ye so mekely liste to daunte<br/>
To my seruise hym that louet&#295; me best<br/>
And of your bounte so graciously to graunte<br/>
That he ne shal barye thoug&#295; hym leste<br/>
Wherof myn herte is fully brought to reste<br/>
For now and euer o lady myn benigne<br/>
That hert and wi&#410;&#410; I hooly to you resigne</p>

<p>Thankyng you wit&#295; al my ful herte<br/>
That of your grace and visitacion<br/>
So humble liste hym to conuerte<br/>
Fully to ben at my subiection<br/>
Wit&#295; oute chaunge or transmutacion<br/>
Vnto his laste, now laude and reuerence<br/>
Be to your name and excellence</p>

<p>This al and sum and chief of my request<br/>
And hool substance of my ful entente<br/>
You thankyng euer of your graunt &amp; hest<br/>
Bot&#295; now and euer that ye me grace sent<br/>
To conquer hym that neuer shal repent<br/>
Me for to serue and humblye for to please<br/>
As fynal tresour of my hertes ease</p>

<p>And than anon venus cast a doun<br/>
In to her lappe braunches whyte and grene<br/>
Of hawthorn that wenten enuyron<br/>
Aboute her heed that ioye was to sene<br/>
And had her kepe hem honestly and clene<br/>
Whiche shold not fade ne neuer wexe olde<br/>
Yf she her biddyng kepe as she hat&#295; told</p>

<p>And as these vowes be bothe fair and swete<br/>
Folowe theffecte that they do specifye<br/>
This is to seyne bot&#295; in cold and hete<br/>
Be ye of one hert and of one fantasye<br/>
As ar these leues whiche may not dye<br/>
By no duresse of stormes that be kene<br/>
Nomore in wynter than in somer grene</p>

<p>Right so by ensample of wele or woo<br/>
For Ioye torment or for aduersite<br/>
Whether so fortune fauoure, or be foo<br/>
For pouert riches or prosperyte<br/>
That ye your hert kepe in on degre<br/>
To loue hym best for no thing that ye fyne<br/>
Whom I haue bound so low vnder your cheyne</p>

<p>And wit&#295; that word the goddesse shoke her heed<br/>
And was in pees &amp; spack as tho nomore<br/>
And therwit&#295; a&#410;&#410; ful femynyn of drede<br/>
Me thought this lady sighen gan ful sore<br/>
And said agayn, lady that maist restore<br/>
Hertes in Ioye from theyr aduersite<br/>
To do your wil de mieulx en mieulx ma gree</p>

<p>Thus euer slepyng dremyng as I laye<br/>
Wit&#295;yn the temple me thought I saye<br/>
Grete prees of folk wit&#295; murmur wonderful<br/>
To croude and shoue, the temple was so ful<br/>
Eueric&#295; ful besy, in his owne cause<br/>
That I ne may shortly in a clause<br/>
Discriuen alle the rites and the guyse<br/>
And eke I wante connyng to deuyse<br/>
How som&#772;e ther were wit&#295; blood, encence &amp; milk<br/>
And som&#772;e wit&#295; flouris sote &amp; softe as silk<br/>
And som&#772;e wit&#295; sparowes &amp; douues whyte<br/>
That for to offren gan hem delyte<br/>
Vnto the goddesse wit&#295; sighe and prayer<br/>
Hem to relese of that they most desire<br/>
That for the prees shortly to conclude<br/>
I wente my way for the multitude<br/>
Me for to refress&#295; out of the prees allone<br/>
And by my self me thought as I gan gone<br/>
Wit&#295; in the estres and gan a whyle tarye<br/>
I sawe a man that walked al solitarye<br/>
That as me semed for heuynes and dole<br/>
Hym to compleyne, that he walked so sole<br/>
Wit&#295; oute espyyng of ony other wight</p>

<p>And yf I s&#295;al diseryuen hym a right<br/>
Yf that he had not ben in heuynes<br/>
Me thought he was, to speke of semelines<br/>
Of shap of fourme, and also of stature<br/>
The most passing, that euer yet nature<br/>
Made in her werkes, and lyke to be a man<br/>
And ther wit&#295; al as I reherce can<br/>
Of face and chere the most gracyous<br/>
To be biloued happy and ewrous<br/>
Bur as it semed outward by his chere<br/>
That he complayned for lack of his desire<br/>
For by hym self as he walked vp and doun<br/>
I herde hym make a lamentacion<br/>
And said alas, what thing may this be<br/>
That now am bonde that whylom was fre<br/>
And wente at large at myn election<br/>
Now am I caught vnder subiection<br/>
For to become a beray homager<br/>
To god of loue, wher er I cam here<br/>
Felt in myn herte, nought of loues peyne<br/>
But now of newe, wit&#295;in hur firy cheyne<br/>
I am embraced so that I may not stryue<br/>
To serue and loue whyle I am on lyue</p>

<p>The godly freshe in the temple yonder<br/>
I sawe right now, that I had wonder<br/>
How euer god, for to rekene a&#410;&#410;<br/>
Might make a thing so celestia&#410;&#410;<br/>
So angelike on erthe to appere<br/>
For wit&#295; the stremes of her eyen clere<br/>
I am wounded euen to the hert<br/>
That fro the det&#295; I may not astert<br/>
And most I meruayle that so sodeinly<br/>
I was so yolde to be at hur mercy<br/>
Wit&#295;oute more, I muste her lust obeye<br/>
Whether that she liste me to lyue or deye<br/>
And take mekely my sodeyn auenture<br/>
For sit&#295; my lif, my det&#295;, and eke my cure<br/>
Is in her hand it wil not auaylle<br/>
To gruoche agayn, for of this bataylle<br/>
The palme is heris, and plainly the victorye<br/>
Yf I rebellid honour none ne glorye<br/>
I might not in ony wyse achyeue<br/>
Sit&#295; I am theolden, how shold I thenne preue<br/>
To renne a wey, I wote hit wil not be<br/>
Thoug&#295; I be loos, at large I may not fle<br/>
O god of loue how sharp is now thyn arowe</p>

<p>How mayst thou now so cruelly and so narowe<br/>
Wit&#295; oute cause hurte me and wounde<br/>
And takest none hede my sorowes to founde<br/>
But liche a birde that fleet&#295; at her desire<br/>
Tyl sodeynly wit&#295;yn the pantere<br/>
She is caught thaug&#295; late she was at large<br/>
Anewe tempest forcastet&#295; now my barge<br/>
Now vp now doun, wit&#295; wynd it is so blowe<br/>
So am I possed and almost ouerthrowe<br/>
For dryue in derknes of many sondry wawe<br/>
Alas whan shal this tempest ouerdrawe<br/>
To clere the skyes of myn aduersite<br/>
The lode sterre whan that I ne may see<br/>
Hit is so hid wit&#295; clowdes that be blake<br/>
Alas whan wy&#410;&#410; this torment ouerslake<br/>
I can not wyte, for who is hurt of newe<br/>
And bledet&#295; inward til he wex pale of hue<br/>
And hat&#295; his wound vnwarly fress&#295; &amp; grene<br/>
And hit is not couthe vnto the harmes kene<br/>
Of myghty cupyde that can so hertes daunte<br/>
That no man may in his warre hym vaunte<br/>
To gete a pryce but only by mekenes<br/>
For ther ne haylet&#295; stryf ne sturdynes</p>

<p>So may I sayne that wit&#295; a loke am yolde<br/>
And haue no power to stryue thaug&#295; I wolde<br/>
Thus stonde I euer betwix lif and det&#295;<br/>
To loue and serue whyle I haue bret&#295;<br/>
In suche a place where I dar not pleyne<br/>
Liche hym that is in torment and in peyne<br/>
And knowet&#295; not to whom to discure<br/>
For ther that I haue holly set my aire<br/>
I dar not wel for drede ne for daunger<br/>
And for vnknowen tellen how the fyre<br/>
Of loues bronde is kyndlid in my breste<br/>
Thus am I murdred and slayn atte leste<br/>
So priuely wit&#295;yn my thought<br/>
O lady venus whom I haue sought<br/>
So wysse me now what me is best to doo<br/>
That am distraught wit&#295; my self so<br/>
That I ne wote what way for to torne<br/>
Sauf by my self soleyn for to morne<br/>
Hangyng in balance betwix hope and drede<br/>
Wit&#295; oute comfort remedye or rede<br/>
For hope biddet&#295; pursue and assaye<br/>
And agaynward drede answert&#295; naye<br/>
And now wit&#295; hope I am set a lofte</p>

<p>But drede and daunger hard &amp; nothyng softe<br/>
Hat&#295; ouerthrowe my trust and put a doun<br/>
Now at my large, now fetred in prisoun<br/>
Now in torment, now in souerayn glorye<br/>
Now in paradyse and now in purgatorye<br/>
As man dispayred in a double were<br/>
Born vp wit&#295; hope, and the&ntilde;e anon daunger<br/>
Me drawet&#295; aback, and sait&#295; it shal not be<br/>
For where as I of myne aduersite<br/>
Am bolde somwhyle mercy to requyre<br/>
Thenne comet&#295; dispair &amp; gynnet&#295; me to lere<br/>
A newe lesson to hope ful the contrary<br/>
They be so diuerse they wil do me varye<br/>
And thus I stand dismayed in a traunce<br/>
For whan that hope were likly me tauaunce<br/>
For drede I tremble &amp; dar one word not speke<br/>
And yf hit so be, that I not out breke<br/>
To telle the harmes that greuen me so sore<br/>
But in my self encrece them more and more<br/>
And to be slayn fully me delyte<br/>
When of my det&#295; she is nothing to wyte<br/>
For but yf she my constreynt plainly knewe<br/>
How shold she euer, on my peynes rue</p>

<p>Thus oft tyme wit&#295; hope I am meuyd<br/>
To tel her a&#410;&#410;, how I am greuyd<br/>
And to be hardy on me for to take<br/>
To axe mercy, but drede dot&#295; me the&ntilde;e awake<br/>
And than wanhop answert&#295; me agayn<br/>
That better were than she haue disdayn<br/>
To dye attones vnknowe of ony wight<br/>
And ther wit&#295; a&#410;&#410; biddet&#295; hope anon right<br/>
Me, to be bold and prayen her of grace<br/>
And fit&#295; alle vertues be portreyd in her face<br/>
Hit were not sittyng, that pyte were behynde<br/>
And right anon wit&#295;yn my self I fynde<br/>
A newe plee brought on me wit&#295; drede<br/>
That me so maset&#295; that I see no spede<br/>
Be cause he sait&#295; that stonyet&#295; al my blood<br/>
I am so symple and she is so good<br/>
Thus hope &amp; drede in me wyl not sece<br/>
To plete and stryue my harmys to encrece<br/>
But at hardest yet or I be dede<br/>
Of my distresse sit&#295; I can no rede<br/>
But stande dom&#772; styl as ony stone<br/>
To fore the goddesse I wil me haste ano&ntilde;<br/>
And compleyne wit&#295; oute more sermo&ntilde;</p>

<p>Thoug&#295; det&#295; be fyn and ful conclusion<br/>
Of my request, yet I wyl assaye<br/>
And right anon me thought I saye<br/>
This woful man as I haue memorye<br/>
Ful lowly entre in to an oratorye<br/>
And knelid a doun in ful humble wyse<br/>
To fore the goddesse and gan anon deuyse<br/>

Allas to whom shal I for help calle<br/>
Not to the muses for cause they ben alle<br/>
Help of right in Ioye and not in woo<br/>

Wherfore they nyl as now directe my style<br/>

And shal so fort&#295; wit&#295;outen ony sleut&#295;<br/>

<p>For leuer I had to deyen sodenly<br/>
Than you offende in any maner wyse<br/>
And suffre paynes inward priuely<br/>

For I right neught wil axe in no wyse<br/>
But for your seruaunt ye wold me accepte<br/>
And whan I trespace, goodly me correcte</p>

Only of grace and womanly pyte<br/>
From day to day that I myght leve<br/>

Fully to ben as you lyst deuyse<br/>
And as ferforth as my wittes can conceyue<br/>
And therwith al liche as ye preue<br/>
That I be true, to guerdone me of grace<br/>
Or ellis to punysshe after my trespace</p>

<p>And yf so be that I may not atteyne<br/>

This is al and som the fyn of my request<br/>
Outher with mercy your seruaunt to saue<br/>
Or mercyles that I may be begraue</p>

<p>And whan this benygne of her entent true<br/>
Conceyued hat&#295; the compleynt of this man<br/>
Right as the fresh rody Rose newe<br/>
Of her colour to wexen she began<br/>
Her blood astoned so from her herte ran<br/>
In to her face of verray femynyte<br/>
Thurgh honest drede abasshed was she</p>

<p>And humbly she began her eyen caste<br/>
Towardes hym of hir benygnyte<br/>
So that no word by her lippes past<br/>
For hast nor drede mercy ne pyte<br/>
For so demened she was in honeste<br/>
That vnaduysed no thing fro her stert<br/>
So moche of reson was compassed in her hert</p>

<p>Til atte last of whiche she did abreyd<br/>

Only in vertu y bridled vnder drede<br/>
Ye must of right nedis face the bet<br/>
Of your request, and the better spede<br/>
But as for me I may of womanhede<br/>
No further graunte to you in myn entente<br/>
Than as my lady venus wil assente</p>

<p>For she wel knoweth I am not at my large<br/>
To doon right nought but by her ordynance<br/>
So am I drownd vnder her dredeful charge<br/>
Her lyste tobbeye withoute variaunce<br/>
But for my parte so hit be pleasaunce<br/>
Vnto the goddesse for trout&#295; in your empryse<br/>

Fully tobeye hir dome and Iugement<br/>
So as hir liste disposen and ordeyne<br/>
Right as she knoweth the trout&#295; of vs tweyne</p>

<p>For vnto the tyme that venus list prouyde<br/>
To shape away for our hertis ease<br/>
Bothe ye and I mekely must abyde<br/>

And for the beste ful ofte is made delaye<br/>
Er men be heled of their maladye<br/>
Wherfore as venus list this mater to gye<br/>
Leet vs agreen, and take al for the best<br/>
Til her liste, sette bothe our hertes in rest</p>

<p>For she is that byndet&#295; and can constreyn<br/>
Hertes in one, this fortunate planete<br/>
And can relece louers of her peyn<br/>
To turne fully her bitter in to swete<br/>
Now blisful goddes doun fro thy sterry sete<br/>
Vs to fortune cast your stremes shene<br/>
Lyke as ye knowe, that we trout&#295; mene</p>

<p>And ther wit&#295; al as I myn eyen caste<br/>
For to perceyue the maner of these tweyne<br/>
To fore the goddesse mekely as they paste<br/>

And suffre neuer that men hem do offence<br/>
For loue of one, but euermore vndertake<br/>

Lete not your corage ne your force faylle<br/>
Nor none assaultes you flitten or remeue<br/>
For vnassayed no man may trout&#295; preue</p>

<p>For whyte is whitter yf it be set by black<br/>
And swete is swetter after bitternes<br/>
And falshed euer is dryue and put a back<br/>
Where trouthe is roted wit&#295; doblenes<br/>

And more of pris whan it is dere bought<br/>
And eke loue stondeth more in sewrte<br/>
Whan it is to fore with payne woo &amp; thought<br/>

<p>Now in this mater what shold I lenger dwelle<br/>
Come ye attones and do as I haue said<br/>
And first my doughter that ar of bounte welle<br/>
In hert and thought be glad &amp; wel apayd<br/>
To done hym grace that shal &amp; hath obeyd<br/>
Your lustes euer, and I wil for his sake<br/>
Of trouth to you be bounde and vndertake</p>

To fore the goddes this fair and wele<br/>
Her humble seruant toke goodly by the hond<br/>
As he to fore her, mekely did knele<br/>

From poynt to poynt in ful thryfty wyse<br/>

From heuynes and from his peynes olde<br/>
Ful reconcyled, and hat&#295; ful suffisance<br/>
Of her that euer ment wel, and wold<br/>
That in good fait&#295; and I tel shold<br/>
The inward mirthes did her hertis brace<br/>
For al my lyf to telle, it were to lityl space</p>

<p>For he hat&#295; wonne hir that he louet&#295; best<br/>
And she to grace hat&#295; take hym of pyte<br/>
And thus her hertes ben bot&#295; set in rest<br/>
Wit&#295;oute chaunge or mutabilite<br/>
And venus hat&#295; of her benygnyte<br/>
Confermed al what shal I lenger tary<br/>
These tweyne in one and neuer to vary</p>

<p>That for the ioye in the temple aboute<br/>
Of this acorde by grete solempnyte<br/>
Was laude and honour within &amp; wit&#295;oute<br/>
Yeue to venus, and to the deyte<br/>
Of god cupide, so that Caliope<br/>
And al her sustren in her armonye<br/>
Soon with songes the goddes did magnifye</p>

<p>And al attones with notes loud &amp; sharp<br/>
They did her honour and her reuerence<br/>
And Orpheus among them with his harp<br/>
Gan strynges touche with his diligence<br/>
And Amphion that hath suche excellence<br/>
Of musyke ay dyde his besynes<br/>
To plese and queme venus the goddesse</p>

<p>Only for cause of the affinyte<br/>
Betwix these two not lusty to disseuere<br/>
And euery louer of lowe and hye degre<br/>
Gan venus pray fro thens fort&#295; and euer<br/>
That hool of them the loue may perseuere<br/>
Wit&#295;outen ende in suche wyse as they gonne<br/>
And more encrece that hit of hard was wonne</p>

<p>And the goddes heryng this request<br/>
As she that knewe the clene entencion<br/>
Of bothe them tweyne made a bihest<br/>
Perpetuelly by confirmacion<br/>
Whylis they lyue of one affection<br/>
They shal endure ther is no more to sayne<br/>
That neyther shal haue mater to complayne</p>

<p>So ferfurt&#295; euermore in our eternal see<br/>
The goddes haue in our presence<br/>
Fully deuysed thurg&#295; their deyte<br/>
And hooly concluded by her Influence<br/>
That by thair myght and Iuste prudence<br/>
The loue of hem by grace and eke fortune<br/>
Wit&#295; oute chaunge shal euermore contune</p>

<p>Of whiche graunt the temple enuiron<br/>
Thurg&#295; hye comfort of them that were present<br/>
Anon was begun wit&#295; a melodyous sowun<br/>
In name of tho that trout&#295; in loue ment<br/>
A balade newe in ful good entent<br/>
To fore the goddes wit&#295; notis londe and clere<br/>
Syngyng right this anon as ye shal here</p>

<p>Fayrest of sterres that with your persant light<br/>
And with the cherysyng of your stremes clere<br/>
Causen in loue hertes to be light<br/>
Only by shynyng of your glad spere<br/>
Now lawde and pryce O venus lady dere<br/>
Be to your name that haue without synne<br/>
This man fortuned his lady for to wynne</p>

<p>Willy planete O esperus so bright<br/>
That woful hertes can appese and stere<br/>
And euer ar redy by your grace &amp; might<br/>

Only wit&#295; twinkyng of your plesaunt chere<br/>
To you we thanke louers that ben here<br/>

<p>And wit&#295; the noyse an heuenly melodye<br/>
Wit&#295; that they made in her armonye<br/>
Thurg&#295; out the temple for this mans sake<br/>
Out of my slepe anon I dyde awake<br/>
And for astonyed knewe as tho no rede<br/>
For sodeyn chaunge oppressed wit&#295; drede<br/>
Me thought I was cast in a traunce<br/>
So clene away was tho my remembrance<br/>
Of alle my dreme, wherof gret thought &amp; wo<br/>
I had in herte and nyst what was to doo<br/>
For heuynes for that I had lost the sight<br/>
Of her that I al the longe nyght<br/>
Had dremed of in myn aduision<br/>
Wherof I made grete lamentacion<br/>
Be cause I had neuer in my lyf beforn<br/>
Saw none so fair sit&#295; that I was born<br/>
For loue of whom so as I can endyte<br/>
I purpose here to make and to wryte<br/>
A lityl tretyse and processe make<br/>
In pryce of women only for her sake<br/>
Hem to comence as it is skyl and right<br/>
For her godenes wit&#295; al my myght<br/>
Prayng to her that is so bounteuous</p>

<p>So ful of vertu and so gracyeus<br/>
Of womanhede and mercyful pyte<br/>
This symple tretyse for to take in gre<br/>
Til I haue leyzer vnto her hye renoun<br/>
For to expound my forsaid visioun<br/>
And tel in playn the signefyaunce<br/>
As it cometh to my remembraunce<br/>
So that her after my lady may hit loke<br/>
Now go thy way thou litil rude boke<br/>
To her presence as I the comande<br/>
And first of a&#410;&#410; thou me recomande<br/>
Vnto hir and to her excellence<br/>
And pray to hir, hit be non offence<br/>
Yf ony word in the be myssaid<br/>
Besechyng her, she be not euyl a paid<br/>
For as her list I wil the efte correcte<br/>
Whan that her liket&#295; ageinward the directe<br/>
I mene that benygne and goodly of face<br/>
Now go thy way and put the in her grace</p>
